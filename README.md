#### Purpose

1. Procure public data releases via the City's Open Data program to support analysis of relevant regulations.
2. Build web application to present all layers of geospatial data related to on-street and city-owned off-street parking regulations in Philadelphia County. Native applications may be on the roadmap at some point, but the first priority is being accessible to the largest number of users.

#### Current Layers
TBD


#### Choosing layers to include

- does the layer contain data that affects when a motorized vehicle may be parked on a public street or city-owned off-street lot?
_That's it_.
